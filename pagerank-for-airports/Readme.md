# PageRank for Airports

In this project, we had to implement the PageRank algorithm for airport data available at Bureau of Transportation website. 

### Program Arguments:

1. Location of the csv file containing the fields, Origin Airport Code and Destination Airport Code
2. Maximum number of iterations to run
3. Location of output file

We computed the Pagerank of each node(airport) based on number of inlinks and outlinks using the standard algorithm.
