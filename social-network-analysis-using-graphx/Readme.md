# Analyzing Social Networks using GraphX

In this project, we used Spark GraphX to analyze social network data. The 'ego-Twitter' dataset was chosen from the SNAP repository: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html#socnets

### Details about the dataset:

The edges in the graph are directed. There are 81,306 nodes and 1,768,149 edges in the dataset which represent social circles from Twitter. 

## Analysis details

The following high-level analysis was done on the twitter data:

a. To find the top 5 nodes with the highest outdegree and find the count of the number of outgoing
edges in each

*Analysis: 3359851 Node has highest out-degree. This implies that this node follows maximum number of other twitter profiles.*

b. To find the top 5 nodes with the highest indegree and find the count of the number of incoming edges
in each

*Analysis: 40981798 Node has the highest in-degree. This implies that this is the sought after profile which might have a heavy following*

c. To calculate PageRank for each of the nodes and output the top 5 nodes with the highest PageRank
values. 

*Analysis: Node 115485051 has the highest pagerank. This implies that this profile is of very high importance and it plays a vital role in influencing with its tweets*

d. To run the connected components algorithm on it and find the top 5 components with the largest
number of nodes.

*Analysis: Since there is only one component, we can say that the entire graph is connected. We donâ€™t have any separate components in the graph. This implies that everyone on twitter is connected to each other via one or another nodes.*

e. To run the triangle counts algorithm on each of the vertices and output the top 5 vertices with the
largest triangle count. In case of ties, randomly select the top 5 vertices.

*Analysis: Node 40981798 has a highest triangle count of 774424 and this implies that many people have this user in common in their mutually 3node connected networks*
